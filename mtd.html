<H2>Course Objectives</H2>
<p>  "Middleware is a software that runs between client and
server processes. It is the "glue" between the client and
server, which makes it possible for them to
communicate to each other. Middleware is written in
such a way that the user never notices it's presence." The objective of this course and the labs are to provide introduction about how to build the middleware architecture using JAVA EJB. Note that there are also various other technologies for such task, howevere JAVA EJB are extensively used in the industry. </p>

<h2> Middleware Porject </h2>
Following document describes the details of the project, as discussed during your TD. 

<p><a href="./Middleware-Project.pdf">Middleware Project</a> </p>

Furthremore, Julien has created a viertual machine (VM) that contains all settings you required for yout project. The following link contains the VM and the documents detialing how to utilise it. If something is not clear in case of VM, please contact Julien.

If you've already installed required libraries on your machine or on the university computer, then you can also use it instead of the provided VM.

<p> <font color="red"> The deadline for the project: <ul> <li> EMSE students: 15/12/2016 </li> <li> All other students except EMSE: 16/01/2017 </li></ul></font></p>
