<H2>Course Objectives</H2>

</CENTER>

HTML is really a very simple language. It consists of ordinary text, with commands that are enclosed by "<" and ">" characters, or bewteen an "&" and a ";". <P>
 

You don't really need to know much HTML to create a page, because you can copy bits of HTML from other pages that do what you want, then change the text!<P>
 

This page shows on the left as it appears in your browser, and the corresponding HTML code appears on the right. The HTML commands are linked to explanations of what they do.
 

 

<H3>Course Fomat</H3>

There will be three classes (CM), each of 1.30 hours, and the class meets every second week. After each class there will be a home assigment, usuall a report for the given material to read. In addition, there will be 4 lab sessions (TD) that will cover the pratical aspects of the course. Finally, there will be a programming project at the end of the course. You can usually find the copies of the slides used in the lecture on this website, a day before the lecture. 
 

<H3>Tentative Grading Breakdown</H3>

<p>Course Work (Reports):  10%</p>

<p>Lab Work: 25%</p>

<p>Programming Project 25%</p>
 
<p>Final Exam: 40%</p>
 
<b>Assignments are due at the beginning of class on the due date, unless otherwise announced. Barring usual circumstances, late homework will not be accepted</b> 
<H3>Additional Material</H3>
Students are allowed to use any book or material related to the topics discussed during the classes. The web is rich source of information, so use it. However, for each lecture I will give some pointers or material that can be helpful. Following are some of the recomended books:

<ul>
	<li>Web Services Essentials by Ethan Cerami </li>
  <li>Service-Oriented Architecture: A Field Guide to Integrating XML and Web Services (Prentice Hall Service-Oriented Computing Series from Thomas Erl)</li>
  <li>Building Web Services with Java: Making Sense of XML, SOAP, WSDL and UDDI by Steve Graham, Simon Simeonov</li>
</ul>


<H2>Course Lectures</H2>
Following is the list of lectures, addtional material to read and the downloadable documents to prepare your reports.

<H3>Lecture 1</H3>
This lecture dicusses the main data formats that are used for sharing and transfering information over the Web. These data formats are the backbone of the services provided, and used, on the Web. Make sure to get the basics of them, it will help you to get the grip on this course. Following is the list of data formats that will be discussed.

<ul>
	<li>XML, DTD, XSD </li>

	<p> The Web is full of XML documentation. However, I quite like the way it is presented on UC Berkeley Website <a href="http://dret.net/lectures/xml-fall11/">(Link)</a>.</p>
	
  <li>JSON</li>
  <p> The official website <a href="http://www.json.org">(Json)</a> contains some information about the syntax and usage. Other sources include <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/json/default.asp">W3schools</a>, <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org/2013/11/08/a-non-programmers-introduction-to-json/">Scot's Blog</a>, etc. </p>
  <li>RDF, OWL</li>
  <p> I would recomend every one to read -- at-least -- first 40 pages of <b>Linked Data and the Semantic Web Standards by Aidan Hogan</b> (can be downloaded at this <a href="http://aidanhogan.com/docs/ldmgmt_semantic_web_linked_data.pdf">Link</a>). It will provide the basics of the Semantic Web, RDF, OWL and Linked Data. </p>

</ul>











<H3>Academic Misconduct</H3>
You can contact be on the following email, but be sure to use "Web-Service Course: &lt; your subject &gt;" (without quotes) in the subject of your eamil. Otherwise, I may not be able to read and reply to your questions.

<H4>Academic Misconduct</H4>
All work turned in is expected to be your own. Although students are encouraged to study together, each student is expected to produce his or her own solution to the homework problems. Coping or using sections of someone else's program, even if it has been modified by you, is not acceptable. The University has very clear guidelines for academic misconduct and the staff of this course will be vigorous in enforcing them.
