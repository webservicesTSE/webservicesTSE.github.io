<H2>Course Objectives</H2>
In general, web services are loosely coupled software components that are published, located and invoked across the Web. The main components of web services include: XML-RPC, SOAP protocol, WSDL and UDDI. These components are evolved from the basics of sharing information over the Web. Web services have become a mainstream development in the industry, where large enterprises (such as Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, AirBnB, etc.) are increasingly relying on them for large scale software development and sharing of services within an organisation. As a result, a multitude of applications are build together by piecing together web services published by third parties. 

<p>The main aim of this course is to introduce the underlying architecture of web services, i.e. data models, data formats, query languages and protocols, as well as a hands-on experience with building interesting web service-based applications. We will begin with the introduction of the data formats to share information on the Web and their respective query languages. We then study the protocols to discover the related web services and how to use them within various applications.  </p>
 

 

<H3>Course Fomat</H3>

There will be three classes (CM), each of 1.30 hours, and the class meets every second week. After each class there will be a home assigment, usually a report for the given material. In addition, there will be 4 lab sessions (TD) that will cover the pratical aspects of the course. Finally, there will be a programming project at the end of the course. You can usually find the copies of the slides used in the lecture on this website, a day before the lecture. 
 

<H3>Tentative Grading Breakdown</H3>

<p>Course Work (Reports):  10%</p>

<p>Lab Work: 25%</p>

<p>Programming Project 25%</p>
 
<p>Final Exam: 40%</p>
 
<b>Assignments are due at the beginning of class on the due date, unless otherwise announced. Barring usual circumstances, late homework will not be accepted</b> 

<H3>Additional Material</H3>
Students are allowed to use any book or material related to the topics discussed during the classes. The Web is rich source of information, so use it. However, for each lecture I will give some pointers or material that can be helpful. Following are some of the recomended books:

<ul>
	<li>Web Services Essentials by Ethan Cerami </li>
  <li>Service-Oriented Architecture: A Field Guide to Integrating XML and Web Services (Prentice Hall Service-Oriented Computing Series from Thomas Erl)</li>
  <li>Building Web Services with Java: Making Sense of XML, SOAP, WSDL and UDDI by Steve Graham, Simon Simeonov</li>
</ul>


<H2>Course Lectures</H2>
Following is the list of lectures, addtional material to read and the downloadable documents to prepare your reports.

<H3>Lecture 1</H3>
This lecture dicusses the main data formats that are used for sharing and transfering information over the Web. These data formats are the backbone of the services provided, and used on the Web. Make sure to get the basics of them, it will help you to get the grip on this course. Following is the (tentative) list of data formats that will be discussed during the class.

<!-- <ul>
	<li>XML, DTD, XSD </li>

	<p> The Web is full of XML documentation. However, I quite like the way it is presented on UC Berkeley Website <a href="http://dret.net/lectures/xml-fall11/">(Link)</a>.</p>
	
  <li>JSON</li>
  <p> The official website <a href="http://www.json.org">(Json)</a> contains some information about the syntax and usage. Other sources include <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/json/default.asp">W3schools</a>, <a href="http://blog.scottlowe.org/2013/11/08/a-non-programmers-introduction-to-json/">Scot's Blog</a>, etc. </p>
  <li>RDF, OWL</li>
  <p> I would recomend every one to read -- at-least -- first 40 pages of <b>Linked Data and the Semantic Web Standards by Aidan Hogan</b> (can be downloaded at this <a href="http://aidanhogan.com/docs/ldmgmt_semantic_web_linked_data.pdf">Link</a>). It will provide the basics of the Semantic Web, RDF, OWL and Linked Data. </p>

<H3> Home Work Assignment 1</H3>
This week's assignment is quite a simple one, be ready to expect advance topics for the next classes. You are asked to write a research summary of the following article. <font color="red">Note: there seems to be a confusion regarding the deadline of the assignments. It's on 21/09/2016, the day of your next class.</font>
<p> <b> The Semantic Web - on the respective Roles of XML and RDF </b> (Downloadable at this <a href="./report.pdf"> link</a>) </p>

<p><b> How to write an effective summary? </b> This question can be answered by simply googling the Web. Some recomended sources are as follows: <a href="http://web2.uconn.edu/ahking/How_to_Summarize_a_Research_Article.pdf"> Francis W. Ahking Recomendations</a> and <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/psych/files/writing_center/summarizing.pdf"> Psychology writing center</a>. I am not setting any specific length of the summary but please don't give me 1/2 a page long summary. </p>







<H2>Contact</H2>
You can contact be on the following email, but be sure<font color="red">  to use "Web-Service Course: &lt; your subject &gt;" (without quotes) in the subject of your email </font>. Otherwise, I may not be able to read and reply to your questions.

<H4>Academic Misconduct</H4>
All work turned in is expected to be your own. Although students are encouraged to study together, each student is expected to produce his or her own solution to the homework problems. Coping or using sections of someone else's program, even if it has been modified by you, is not acceptable. The University has very clear guidelines for academic misconduct and the staff of this course will be vigorous in enforcing them.
